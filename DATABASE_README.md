# Teacher Dashboard Database Structure

## Overview
This database schema is designed to support a comprehensive Teacher Dashboard system for school management. It covers all aspects of teacher functionality including class management, attendance tracking, homework assignments, student progress monitoring, and communication.

## Core Architecture

### 🏫 **Multi-tenancy Support**
- **School-based isolation**: Each school is a separate tenant
- **Academic year management**: Support for multiple academic years
- **Data segregation**: All data is partitioned by school_id

### 🔑 **Primary Entities**

#### **Teachers**
- Complete teacher profile management
- Professional qualifications and experience tracking
- Subject specialization mapping
- Authentication and session management

#### **Students**
- Student information with parent/guardian details
- Academic enrollment tracking
- Multi-year history support

#### **Classes**
- Dynamic class creation (Grade + Section)
- Teacher-class-subject assignments
- Student enrollment management

## 📊 **Feature-Specific Tables**

### **Attendance Management**
```sql
attendance_records        -- Daily attendance sessions
student_attendance       -- Individual student status
```
- **Flexible attendance**: Support for multiple periods per day
- **Status tracking**: Present, Absent, Late, Excused
- **Bulk operations**: Efficient marking for entire classes

### **Homework System**
```sql
homework_assignments     -- Teacher-created assignments
homework_submissions     -- Student submissions with grading
```
- **Rich content**: Text, attachments, instructions
- **Grading workflow**: Marks, grades, feedback
- **Due date tracking**: Automatic status updates

### **Assessment & Grading**
```sql
assessments             -- Tests, quizzes, projects
assessment_results      -- Individual student scores
student_grades         -- Term-wise consolidated grades
```
- **Multiple assessment types**: Configurable weightage
- **Comprehensive grading**: Marks, percentages, ranks
- **Progress tracking**: Term-wise academic progress

### **Communication**
```sql
messages               -- Direct messaging system
announcements         -- Broadcast communications
notifications         -- System-generated alerts
```
- **Multi-party communication**: Teachers ↔ Parents ↔ Students
- **Targeted messaging**: Class/grade-specific announcements
- **Real-time notifications**: Homework due, attendance alerts

### **Scheduling**
```sql
time_slots            -- School period definitions
timetable            -- Class-wise schedule management
```
- **Flexible scheduling**: Configurable time slots
- **Conflict detection**: Prevent double-booking
- **Historical tracking**: Schedule changes over time

## 🔒 **Security & Performance**

### **Authentication**
- **JWT token management**: Secure session handling
- **Password hashing**: bcrypt encryption
- **Session tracking**: IP and device monitoring

### **Activity Logging**
- **Comprehensive audit trail**: All user actions logged
- **Security monitoring**: Login attempts, data access
- **Debugging support**: System troubleshooting

### **Performance Optimization**
- **Strategic indexing**: Query performance optimization
- **Efficient relationships**: Proper foreign key constraints
- **Bulk operations**: Support for batch processing

## 📈 **Data Relationships**

### **Core Hierarchies**
```
School → Academic Years → Classes → Students
School → Teachers → Subject Assignments → Classes
```

### **Activity Flows**
```
Teacher → Creates Homework → Students Submit → Teacher Grades
Teacher → Marks Attendance → System Generates Reports
Teacher → Sends Message → Parent/Student Receives
```

## 🚀 **Scalability Features**

### **Horizontal Scaling**
- **UUID primary keys**: Distributed system ready
- **School-based partitioning**: Easy sharding by school_id
- **Stateless design**: Session data externalized

### **Data Growth Management**
- **Archive strategies**: Historical data retention
- **Efficient queries**: Indexed common access patterns
- **Bulk operations**: Batch processing support

## 📋 **Common Query Patterns**

### **Teacher Dashboard Queries**
```sql
-- Get teacher's assigned classes
SELECT c.*, g.name as grade_name 
FROM classes c 
JOIN teacher_class_assignments tca ON c.id = tca.class_id
JOIN grades g ON c.grade_id = g.id
WHERE tca.teacher_id = ?;

-- Get pending homework submissions
SELECT ha.title, COUNT(hs.id) as submitted_count, 
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM student_enrollments WHERE class_id = ha.class_id) as total_students
FROM homework_assignments ha
LEFT JOIN homework_submissions hs ON ha.id = hs.homework_assignment_id
WHERE ha.teacher_id = ? AND ha.status = 'active'
GROUP BY ha.id;

-- Get attendance statistics
SELECT 
    AVG(present_count::float / total_students * 100) as avg_attendance,
    COUNT(*) as total_classes
FROM attendance_records 
WHERE teacher_id = ? 
  AND attendance_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

### **Performance Monitoring**
- **Index usage**: Monitor query performance
- **Connection pooling**: Database connection optimization  
- **Caching strategies**: Frequent data caching

## 🔧 **Maintenance & Backup**

### **Regular Maintenance**
- **Statistics updates**: Keep query planner optimized
- **Index rebuilding**: Maintain performance
- **Data cleanup**: Archive old academic years

### **Backup Strategy**
- **Daily backups**: Full database backup
- **Transaction log backup**: Point-in-time recovery
- **Cross-region replication**: Disaster recovery

This database structure provides a solid foundation for the Teacher Dashboard system with room for future enhancements and scaling.
